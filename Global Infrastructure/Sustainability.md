Amazon co-founded the Climate Pledge to achieve Net-Zero Carbon Emissions by 2040 across all of Amazon's business' (including AWS)
The goals follow 3 parts

# 1. Renewable Energy

AWS is working towards having its AWS Global Infrastructure powered by 100% renewable energy by 2025.

AWS purchases and retires environmental attributes to cover the non-renewable energy for AWS Global Infrastructure:

* Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
* Guarantees of Origin (GOs)

# 2. Cloud Efficiency

AWS’s infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy-efficient than the median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed.

# 3. Water Stewardship

Direct evaporative technology to cool our data center Use of non-potable water for cooling purposes (recycled water)

On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles Water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region
