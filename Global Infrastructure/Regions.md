Regions are geographically distinct locations consisting of one or more [[Global Infrastructure/Availability Zones]]

Every region is physically isolated from each other and independent of other regions in terms of location, power, water supply.

# General Tidbits
- Each region *generally* has three [[Global Infrastructure/Availability Zones]]
- New services almost always become available first in US-EAST
- Not all AWS services are available in all regions
- Billing information appears in US-EAST-1
- The cost of AWS services vary per region

# Things to Consider when Choosing a Region
1. What Regulatory Compliance does this region meet?
2. What is the cost of AWS services in this region?
3. What AWS services are available in this region?
4. What is the distance or latency to my end-users?
