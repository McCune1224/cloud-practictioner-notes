Allows for edge-computing on 5G Networks. Applications will have ultra-low latency being as close as possible to the users.

You can create subnet tied to a wavelength Zone that you can launch VM's to the edge of the targeted 5g network using a telecom companies 5g towers (Verizon, SK Telecom, etc)
